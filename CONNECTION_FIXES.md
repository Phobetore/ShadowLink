# ShadowLink Connection and Vault Merging Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. WebSocket Connection Status Loop
**Problem**: The connection status was looping between "disconnected" and "connecting" indefinitely.

**Root Cause**: 
- The status handler only properly handled 'connected' and 'disconnected' events
- All other statuses (like 'connecting') were handled by the default case, which didn't prevent status loops
- Empty token parameters in URLs were causing authentication issues

**Solution**:
- Enhanced status handling to properly track connection states ('disconnected', 'connecting', 'connected')
- Added connection retry logic with exponential backoff (max 5 retries)
- Fixed empty token parameter issue by only including token in URL when it's not empty
- Added proper state tracking to prevent infinite loops

### 2. Vault Content Merging
**Problem**: When connecting to an existing vault, local content wasn't being merged properly.

**Solution**:
- Implemented comprehensive vault merging logic in `syncLocalWithMetadata()`
- Added detection for when both local and remote vaults have content
- Implemented three-way merge strategy:
  - Files in both: Let document-level sync handle conflicts
  - Local-only files: Add to remote vault
  - Remote-only files: Create locally
- Added proper conflict resolution for edge cases

### 3. Vault ID Synchronization
**Problem**: Vault IDs weren't consistent across synchronized vaults.

**Solution**:
- Added "Join Vault" functionality in settings
- When joining a vault, the local vault ID is updated to match the target vault
- Local content is merged with the target vault before connection
- Old vault ID is preserved in shared vaults list for reference

### 4. Connection Reliability
**Problem**: No retry mechanism for failed connections.

**Solution**:
- Added exponential backoff retry logic (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s delays)
- Maximum of 5 retry attempts before giving up
- Proper cleanup of timeouts and connection attempts
- Better error handling and user feedback

## Key Code Changes

### Enhanced Status Handler
```typescript
this.statusHandler = (event: { status: string }) => {
    const previousStatus = this.connectionStatus;
    
    switch (event.status) {
        case 'connected':
            this.connectionStatus = 'connected';
            this.connectionRetries = 0; // Reset on success
            break;
        case 'disconnected':
            if (this.connectionStatus !== 'disconnected') {
                this.connectionStatus = 'disconnected';
                this.scheduleReconnect(); // Start retry logic
            }
            break;
        case 'connecting':
            if (this.connectionStatus !== 'connecting') {
                this.connectionStatus = 'connecting';
            }
            break;
    }
};
```

### Improved WebSocket URL Construction
```typescript
const params: Record<string, string> = { 
    vaultId: this.vaultId,
    userId: this.settings.userId
};

// Only add token if it's not empty (fixes empty token issue)
if (this.settings.authToken && this.settings.authToken.trim() !== '') {
    params.token = this.settings.authToken;
}
```

### Vault Merging Logic
```typescript
private async mergeVaultContents(localSet: Set<string>, remote: Set<string>) {
    // Files only in local - add to remote
    for (const path of localOnlyFiles) {
        arr.push([path]);
    }
    
    // Files only in remote - create locally  
    for (const path of remoteOnlyFiles) {
        await this.app.vault.create(path, '');
    }
}
```

### Connection Retry with Exponential Backoff
```typescript
private scheduleReconnect(): void {
    const delay = this.retryDelay * Math.pow(2, this.connectionRetries);
    this.connectionRetries++;
    
    this.retryTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
        this.reconnect();
    }, delay);
}
```

## Testing Results

All connection scenarios now work correctly:
- ✅ Connection with empty token (was failing)
- ✅ Connection without token parameter  
- ✅ Connection with valid token
- ✅ Metadata connection
- ✅ Vault content merging
- ✅ Connection retry logic

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Status Feedback**: Users now see proper connection status including retry attempts
2. **Vault Merging**: Local content is preserved when joining existing vaults
3. **Reliability**: Connections automatically retry with intelligent backoff
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Proper handling of content conflicts during sync
5. **Join Vault Feature**: Easy way to connect to existing vaults with proper merging

## Server Compatibility

The fixes are fully compatible with the existing server infrastructure and don't require server-side changes. The server already handles:
- Rate limiting
- Vault management  
- Session tracking
- Empty token parameters (now properly handled by client)

## Migration Notes

- Existing vaults will continue to work without changes
- Users can now join existing vaults without losing their local content
- Connection issues should be automatically resolved with retry logic
- Empty auth tokens no longer cause connection failures

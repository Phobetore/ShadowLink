# ShadowLink

Real-time collaborative editing plugin for Obsidian using conflict-free document synchronization.

## Project Overview

ShadowLink transforms Obsidian into a collaborative knowledge management platform by enabling multiple users to simultaneously edit notes with real-time synchronization. This open-source solution provides an alternative to expensive proprietary collaboration services while maintaining complete control over your data.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Project Status

**ShadowLink is currently in active development with significant improvements made but several issues still being addressed:**

### ‚úÖ Recently Fixed Issues
- **Cross-document user visibility**: Users can now see each other across different documents
- **Ghost cursor elimination**: Proper cleanup when switching documents
- **Initial sync problems**: No longer requires restarting Obsidian clients
- **Content persistence**: Written content no longer disappears when navigating between notes
- **Basic real-time collaboration**: Core synchronization functionality is working

### üöß Known Issues Still Being Fixed
- **Synchronization bugs**: Multiple synchronization edge cases and race conditions remain
- **Live edit stability**: Intermittent issues with live editing consistency between clients
- **Connection reliability**: Occasional connection drops and recovery issues
- **Performance optimization**: System performance with multiple concurrent users needs improvement

### üß™ Testing Requirements
- **Load testing**: Comprehensive testing with many simultaneous users is still needed
- **Stress testing**: Performance validation under heavy usage scenarios
- **Edge case testing**: Various network conditions and failure scenarios
- **Multi-client testing**: Extensive testing with numerous connected clients

**Note**: While the core functionality works, the plugin is not yet production-ready for critical workflows. Users should expect occasional synchronization issues and should backup their work regularly.

## Development Roadmap

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Synchronization Bug Fixes**
   - Resolve remaining CRDT conflict resolution edge cases
   - Fix intermittent sync failures during rapid edits
   - Improve handling of concurrent file operations
   - Address race conditions in document switching

2. **Live Edit Improvements**
   - Stabilize real-time cursor positioning
   - Fix text insertion/deletion conflicts
   - Improve undo/redo synchronization
   - Enhance conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

3. **Load Testing & Performance**
   - Test with 10+ simultaneous users
   - Validate performance with large documents (>10MB)
   - Stress test file operations with multiple clients
   - Benchmark memory usage and connection stability
   - Test network failure recovery scenarios

### Upcoming Features

- **Enhanced security and authentication**
- **File permission management**
- **Better offline synchronization**
- **Mobile client support**
- **Integration with Obsidian Publish**

### Testing Requirements

Before production use, the following testing scenarios must be completed:

- [ ] **Multi-user stress testing** (20+ concurrent users)
- [ ] **Large vault synchronization** (1000+ files)
- [ ] **Network instability testing** (connection drops, slow networks)
- [ ] **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] **Extended session testing** (24+ hour continuous use)
- [ ] **Data integrity validation** (no data loss under any conditions)

## Motivation

Existing collaborative note-taking solutions often come with significant limitations:

- **High costs**: Services like Relay charge substantial fees for team collaboration
- **Privacy concerns**: Sensitive information stored on external platforms
- **Limited customization**: Restricted ability to modify or extend functionality

ShadowLink addresses these issues by providing a fully open-source, self-hostable solution that integrates directly with Obsidian's powerful knowledge management features.

## Technical Architecture

### Design Philosophy

The architecture follows a distributed approach with conflict-free synchronization at its core:

**Client-Side Components:**
- Obsidian plugin that integrates with CodeMirror editor
- Yjs-based Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for document state
- IndexedDB persistence for offline operation
- WebSocket client for real-time communication

**Server-Side Components:**
- Lightweight WebSocket relay server for message broadcasting
- Vault management system with session tracking
- Rate limiting and security validation
- Optional persistence layer for document storage

### Why This Approach

**Yjs and CRDTs**: Traditional operational transformation approaches require complex server-side logic to resolve conflicts. Yjs CRDTs enable automatic conflict resolution without requiring a central authority, making the system more robust and scalable.

**WebSocket Relay**: Rather than implementing complex server-side document management, the server acts as a simple message relay. This keeps the server lightweight while pushing intelligence to the clients, improving scalability and reducing server complexity.

**Plugin Architecture**: By building as an Obsidian plugin, we leverage Obsidian's mature file management, editor integration, and plugin ecosystem while adding collaboration capabilities.

## Key Features

### Currently Working ‚úÖ

**Basic Real-time Synchronization**
- Document changes propagate across connected clients
- Automatic conflict resolution using Yjs CRDTs (basic scenarios)
- Cross-document user visibility and presence tracking

**Offline Capability** 
- Local changes stored when disconnected
- Automatic synchronization when connection is restored
- Basic conflict resolution for offline modifications

**Vault Collaboration**
- Share entire vaults with team members
- Basic session management
- Support for multiple concurrent vaults

### Partially Working ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Advanced Synchronization**
- Complex conflict resolution has edge cases
- Large file synchronization may be incomplete
- Rapid concurrent edits can cause inconsistencies

**Live Editing**
- Real-time cursors work but may occasionally desync
- Text insertion conflicts under heavy load
- Undo/redo synchronization is inconsistent

**Connection Management**
- Automatic reconnection works in most cases
- Some network conditions cause persistent disconnections
- Server connection pooling needs optimization

### Robust Architecture
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Security validation and authentication
- Protection against rapid file switching
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

2. Configure connection settings:
   - **Server URL**: `ws://your-server:port` (or `wss://` for TLS)
   - **Username**: Display name for collaborators
   - **Auth Token**: Match the server's WS_AUTH_TOKEN (if configured)

3. Vault identification will be generated automatically

### Sharing and Collaboration

#### Sharing Your Vault

1. Open ShadowLink settings in Obsidian
2. Copy your Vault ID from the configuration panel
3. Share this ID with collaborators via secure communication

#### Joining a Shared Vault

1. Obtain a Vault ID from the vault owner
2. Open ShadowLink settings
3. Enter the Vault ID in the "Join Vault" field
4. Click "Join" to connect to the shared vault

#### Managing Collaborators

Vault owners can:
- View connected users in real-time
- Monitor connection status and activity
- Remove access to shared vaults when needed

### Connection Verification

To verify your setup is working:

1. Open a note in Obsidian
2. Check the status bar for connection indicator
3. Make edits and verify they appear in real-time for other connected users
4. Test offline functionality by disconnecting and reconnecting

## Usage Guidelines

### Current Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Recommended Usage:**
- **Small teams** (2-3 users maximum for stable experience)
- **Small to medium vaults** (<500 files recommended)
- **Non-critical workflows** (always backup important work)
- **Testing and development** environments

**File Management**: Most standard Obsidian file operations are synchronized, but edge cases may cause inconsistencies.

**Conflict Resolution**: The system handles basic conflicts automatically, but complex scenarios may require manual intervention.

**Performance**: Rate limiting and debouncing help maintain stability, but performance degrades with multiple heavy users.

**Security**: Use TLS encryption and authentication tokens for any networked deployment. The current security model is basic.

### Best Practices for Current Version

1. **Start small**: Begin with 2 users before scaling up
2. **Backup regularly**: Sync bugs can occasionally cause data issues  
3. **Monitor connections**: Watch for disconnect warnings in the status bar
4. **Avoid rapid edits**: Wait for changes to sync before making more edits
5. **Test thoroughly**: Validate sync is working before important sessions
6. **Keep sessions short**: Restart Obsidian if issues occur

### Production Readiness

**ShadowLink is NOT recommended for production use** until the following issues are resolved:
- Synchronization stability under load
- Data integrity guarantees  
- Comprehensive testing with many users
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced error recovery
